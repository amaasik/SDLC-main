        <h1>Käitumisel põhinev arendus </h1> 

<p>
    Käitumisel põhinev arendus (ingl. behavior-driven development, lühendatult BDD) on tarkvaraarenduse meetod, mis on välja arenenud testimisel põhinevast arendusest. Käitumisel põhinev arendus kombineerib testimisel põhineva arenduse üldiseid tehnikaid ja põhimõtted. Selle eesmärk on pakkuda arendustiimile ja juhtivtiimile jagatud tööriista tarkvara arendamisel
   <br> Käitumisel põhineva arenduse osana kasutatakse tavalise lause konstruktsiooni, mis väljendab käitumist või tulemust.

        <h1>Design-driven development </h1> 

<p>
    Design driven development uses design as part of a process to learn and better define requirements in order to build better, more informed technology solutions. 
    <br>
    It can also be looked at as a process whereby design and user experience drives the development of a product or software application. This leads to products that people enjoy using and want to tell others about.

    <button class="accordion">Domain-driven design</button>
    <div class="panel">
      
        <h1>Domain-driven design </h1> 

<p>
    Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach focusing on modelling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.
    <br>
    In terms of object-oriented programming it means that the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain.
    <br> For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes like LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.
    <br>
    DDD connects the implementation to an evolving model.
    <br>
    Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:
    <ul>placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;</ul>
    <ul>basing complex designs on a model of the domain;</ul>
    <ul>    initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.
    </ul>
    <ul>    Criticisms of domain-driven design argue that developers must typically implement a great deal of isolation and encapsulation to maintain the model as a pure and helpful construct. While domain-driven design provides benefits such as maintainability, Microsoft recommends it only for complex domains where the model provides clear benefits in formulating a common understanding of the domain.

    <button class="accordion">Secure by design</button>
    <div class="panel">
      
        <h1>Secure by design </h1> 

<p>
    Secure by design, in software engineering, means that software products and capabilities have been designed to be foundationally secure.
    Alternate security strategies, tactics and patterns are considered at the beginning of a software design, and the best are selected and enforced by the architecture, and they are used as guiding principles for developers. It is also encouraged to use strategic design patterns that have beneficial effects on security, even though those design patterns were not originally devised with security in mind.Secure by Design is increasingly becoming the mainstream development approach to ensure security and privacy of software systems. In this approach, security is considered and built into the system at every layer and starts with a robust architecture design.
    <br> Security architectural design decisions are based on well-known security strategies, tactics, and patterns defined as reusable techniques for achieving specific quality concerns. Security tactics/patterns provide solutions for enforcing the necessary authentication, authorization, confidentiality, data integrity, privacy, accountability, availability, safety and non-repudiation requirements, even when the system is under attack. In order to ensure the security of a software system, not only is it important to design a robust intended security architecture but it is also necessary to map updated security strategies, tactics and patterns to software development in order to maintain security persistence.

    <button class="accordion">Test-driven development</button>
    <div class="panel">
      
        <h1>Testimisel põhinev arendus </h1> 

<p>
    Testimisel põhinev arendus (inglise keeles test-driven development, lühend TDD) on tarkvaraarenduse meetod, kus testid kirjutatakse enne tarkvara ennast.
    <br> Arendusprotsess koosneb lühikestest iteratsioonidest, kus esmalt kirjutatakse ebaõnnestuv test ning seejärel minimaalne kood, et see test läbi läheks. Selline arendus tagab olukorra, kus kogu kood on alati testitud. Sellisel viisil kirjutatud koodi on kergem refaktoreerida ning testid aitavad ka programmi eeldatavat käitumist dokumenteerida. Testimisel põhinevat arendust rakendatakse ka olemasoleva koodi täiustamisel ja silumisel.

    <button class="accordion">Acceptance test-driven development</button>
    <div class="panel">
      
        <h1>Acceptance test-driven development </h1> 

<p>
    Acceptance test–driven development (ATDD) is a development methodology based on communication between the business customers, the developers, and the testers.
    <br> ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as specification by example (SBE),behavior-driven development (BDD), example-driven development (EDD), and support-driven development also called story test–driven development (SDD). All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customer's needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language.
ATDD is closely related to test-driven development (TDD). It differs by the emphasis on developer-tester-business customer collaboration. ATDD encompasses acceptance testing, but highlights writing acceptance tests before developers begin coding.

<button class="accordion">Continuous test-driven development</button>
    <div class="panel">
      
        <h1>Continuous test-driven development </h1> 

<p>
    Continuous test-driven development (CTDD) is a software development practice that extends test-driven development (TDD) by means of automatic test execution in the background, sometimes called continuous testing.
<br>
In CTDD the developer writes a test first but is not forced to execute the tests manually. The tests are run automatically by a continuous testing tool running in the background. This technique can potentially reduce the time waste resulting from manual test execution by eliminating the need for the developer to start the test after each phase of the normal TDD practice: after writing the (initially failing) test, after producing the minimal amount of code for the test to pass and after refactoring the code.

    <button class="accordion">Data-driven development</button>
    <div class="panel">
      
        <h1>Data-driven development</h1> 

<p>
    In computer programming, data-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the program statements describe the data to be matched and the processing required rather than defining a sequence of steps to be taken. 
    <br>
    Standard examples of data-driven languages are the text-processing languages sed and AWK, where the data is a sequence of lines in an input stream – these are thus also known as line-oriented languages – and pattern matching is primarily done via regular expressions or line numbers.
</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Data-oriented design</button>
    <div class="panel">
      
        <h1>Data-oriented design </h1> 

<p>
    In computing, data-oriented design is a program optimization approach motivated by efficient usage of the CPU cache, used in video game development. 
   <br> The approach is to focus on the data layout, separating and sorting fields according to when they are needed, and to think about transformations of data. Proponents include Mike Acton, Scott Meyers, and Jonathan Blow.
    The parallel array (or structure of arrays) is the main example of data-oriented design. It is contrasted with the array of structures typical of object-oriented designs.
